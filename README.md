# DragBoxStack
Create basic box stacking configurations using drag-and-drop, export them to XML.

There are several automatic pallet stack pattern generation tools on the market. They usually find good solutions, but lack flexibility.
Sometimes it can be easier to define your own solution, or there are other circustances, i.e. overlap needed (bag stacking).

Creating this software poses a few interesting challenges in WPF, so doing it to improve my skills...
